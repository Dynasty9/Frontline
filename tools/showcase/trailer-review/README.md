# Comparing Frontline trailers

Each edition runs 25.5 seconds (765 frames at 30 fps). Keep the original homepage reel as edition 00. After each edit, watch the export with Video Tool, including the game audio. Archive the cut with a note about the change and any moment that still needs work.

From the repository root:

```sh
# Record every required shot from this checkout and assemble the trailer.
python3 .agents/skills/website-footage/scripts/record.py --render reel --work /tmp/frontline-trailer

# When only the edit changed, reuse those recordings.
python3 .agents/skills/website-footage/scripts/build.py reel --work /tmp/frontline-trailer

# Save the reviewed cut, captions and capture/edit recipe in build/trailer-review.
python3 tools/showcase/trailer-review/archive.py /tmp/frontline-trailer/build/reel.mp4 \
  --takes /tmp/frontline-trailer/takes --label '01 · Squad to harbour' --note 'Describe the outcome you saw on playback.'
```

Open `build/trailer-review/index.html` directly. Pick two editions, listen to either track and scrub both pictures together. The gallery is local. To share it, copy the entire gallery folder. Each edition keeps its recipe. Passing `--takes` also preserves the recording date, game revision and launch arguments for each take.

The edit opens on a readable action at squad scale, expands through infantry and armour, and gives the final aircraft approach and water impacts time to play as one event. Check the first ten seconds muted and the final approach with sound. These checks follow [Valve’s gameplay trailer guidance](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/trailer) and [Derek Lieu’s line of rising action](https://www.derek-lieu.com/blog/2018/9/16/the-trailer-line-of-rising-action).

For a mix revision, keep the cut points fixed and compare editions with the audio selector. The reel's `score` names a separate take mixed continuously under the native effects. Its Godot scene records the game's battle cue and victory sting with a fixed musical seed. Edit the scene to retime the crescendo, or edit the gain in the recipe to rebalance the music against the effects.
